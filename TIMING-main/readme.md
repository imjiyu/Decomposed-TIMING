## Introduction
Official implementation for **TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation**. TIMING is implemented in PyTorch and tested on different time series datasets, including switch-feature, state, Mimic-III, PAM, Epilespy, boiler, freezer, and wafer. Our overall experiments are based on [time_interpret](https://github.com/josephenguehard/time_interpret), [ContraLSP](https://github.com/zichuan-liu/ContraLSP), [TimeX++](https://github.com/zichuan-liu/TimeXplusplus), [WinIT](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/WinIT). 
Sincere thanks to each of the original authors!



## Installation instructions

```shell script
conda create -n timing python==3.10.16
conda activate timing
pip install -r requirement.txt --no-deps
```
The requirements.txt file is used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment.

To test with switch-feature, additional setup is required.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/TimeSynth/TimeSynth.git
cd TimeSynth
python setup.py install
cd ..
python synthetic/switchstate/switchgenerator.py
```

### MIMIC-III Dataset Setup

To use MIMIC-III dataset, you need to download the original dataset and set up a PostgreSQL database.

**1. Download MIMIC-III Dataset**

- Download from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) (requires credentialed access and CITI training)
- Sign the Data Use Agreement (DUA) and download all CSV files

**2. Load into PostgreSQL**

- Clone the MIMIC-III code repository:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code.git
cd mimic-code/mimic-iii/buildmimic/postgres
```
- Follow the repository instructions to create database `mimic` with schema `mimiciii` and load CSV files

**3. Configure Database Connection**

Edit `datasets/mimic3.py` (around lines 151-157) to set your PostgreSQL connection:
```python
dbname = "mimic"
schema_name = "mimiciii"
# Set host, user, and password as needed
```



## Reproducing experiments

We have divided our experiments into two categories: Synthetic and Real.

All experiments can be executed using scripts located in scripts/real, scripts/hmm, or scripts/switchfeature.

This is an example execution for MIMIC-III (ours)
```shell script
bash scripts/real/train.sh
bash scripts/real/run_mimic_our.sh
bash scripts/real/run_mimic_baseline.sh
```

Due to differences between our training environment and the released code, the paper’s results may not be fully reproducible with the training scripts alone. All XAI evaluations were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU (24GB VRAM). We have publicly released [all model checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nX9x2iBTcFUykHsKAj_1xQftWvZtc1B6/view?usp=sharing), except those trained on the restricted-access MIMIC-III dataset.

All results will be stored in the current working directory.

And then save parsing results:
```shell script
python real/parse.py --model state --data mimic3 --top_value 100
python real/parse.py --model state --data mimic3 --experiment_name baseline --top_value 100
```

All parsed results will be saved in the results/ directory.
